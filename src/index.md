<h1 id="greeting">Hi! üëãüèº I'm Brent.</h1>
<p>I'm a software engineer based in Portland, Oregon that specializes in Ruby on Rails with a double-minor in frontend development and agile processes/organizational design. I believe that boring tech is good tech, and that we must build software for real users, taking their needs and foibles into account.</p>

<h2>Ruby on Rails is just the best</h2>

<p>I have been working in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> since 2005, when Rails was at v0.9.7. It's come a long way. It's not perfect by any means &mdash; no framework is &mdash; but it's still the best thing I've seen for rapid iteration on a web app. The minimal boilerplate along with the expressiveness of Ruby make it a pleasure to work in.</p>

<p>With the recent addition of the <a href="https://hotwired.dev/">Hotwire</a> stack, in particular <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">Stimulus</a> and its bestie <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">StimulusReflex</a>, building a web app with server-side rendering and a reactive pattern is a breeze.</p>

<h2>Where I want to be</h2>

<p>I'm excited about working for a company that's trying to make the world a better place: climate tech, healthcare and science are three sectors I'm interested in. But, a brief warning about AI &mdash; if you say you're using AI then you probably can't be doing good things for the environment. AI consumes energy like it's going out of style.</p>

<p>My ideal role is at the senior or lead level, where I can not only contribute technically but also work on some of the more human and process parts of the team. I have extensive process design and facilitation experience, and it's work that I find profoundly satisfying.</p>
