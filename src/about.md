<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I've got a rather unusual personal history. I've lived on three continents. I'm a native speaker of English and French, and am operationally fluent in Japanese, although I'm still working being able to read the newspaper. Only a few hundred kanji left to go&hellip;</p>

<p>By training, I'm a plant evolutionary ecologist, although I left that career path behind before finishing my Ph.D. I'm a fully self-taught engineer, and have learned a lot along the way about how organizations work, how teams work, how software work happens, and how people come together to get work done.</p>

<p>For fun, I'm all about food, both making and eating! Also, <a href="https://sorashodo.com/">Japanese calligraphy</a>, <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/foliosus/albums/72057594052965540/">plant photography</a>, and boardgames. And don't forget the kittenz! ðŸ˜»</p>

<h2>Some things I've built</h2>

<p>In addition to my work for the companies listed on my <a href="/resume">resume</a>, I've also built these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mixologi.st">Mixologi.st</a>: a collection of my favorite cocktails, mostly vintage recipes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://angelitasurmon.com">Angelita Surmon's site</a>: Angie is a local artist. I've been maintaining her site for years.</li>
  <li><a href="https://doubtaboutwill.org">Doubt About Will</a>: A site that assembles many arguments skeptical that the guy from Stratford is the guy who wrote the plays. Security has been an issue, because of the tourism industry in Stratford-upon-Avon.</li>
  <li><a href="https://fixyourownback.com">FixYourOwnBack.com</a>: I built a previous version of this site with <a href="https://drphillipsnell.com/">Dr. Phillip Snell</a> (my chiropractor!), designed to get pre- and post- intervention data to prove that ~75% of people with discogenic lower back pain could heal themselves with online training without hands-on chiropractic treatment. We got scooped on publication by other chiropractors, so we dismantled the site and pivoted to an off-the-shelf e-learning platform.</li>
</ul>
